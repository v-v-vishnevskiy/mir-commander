# Mir Commander

The primary goal of this project is the creation of a graphical user interface (GUI) for scientific modelling
using [Mir](https://mir.vishnevskiy.group) language and [UNEX](https://unex.vishnevskiy.group) program.
UNEX is a well established software for molecular structure refinement.
Accordingly, Mir Commander will be able to visualize molecular structures as well as other types of numerical data.

Currently we are focused on the very basic functionality, allowing visualizing molecules from files in the standard XYZ format.
