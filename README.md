# Mir Commander

The primary goal of this project is the creation of a graphical user interface (GUI) for scientific modelling
using [Mir](https://mir.vishnevskiy.group) language and [UNEX](https://unex.vishnevskiy.group) program.
UNEX is a well established software for molecular structure refinement.
Accordingly, Mir Commander will be able to visualize molecular structures as well as other types of numerical data.

Currently we are focused on the very basic functionality, allowing visualizing molecules from files in the standard XYZ format.

## Development

### Linux/Mac
As a prerequisite you have to create a virtual environment and install the required packages (in the command line):
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

The development version of Mir Commander can now be started in the virtual environment as
```
PYTHONPATH=. python3 mir_commander
```

Exiting from the virtual environment can be done by calling the function
```
deactivate
```

In the following the `dev_run.sh` script can be used for fast starting of Mir Commander.

### Windows
In Windows you may need first to install Python3 and Git.
Then in a similar manner as for Linux, it is best to work in a virtual environment.
So the first steps are (run in `cmd` from the top level directory of the repository)
```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

Mir Commander can now be started from the `cmd` command line in the virtual environment as
```
cmd /V /C "set "PYTHONPATH=." && python mir_commander"
```

To exit from the virtual environment run
```
.venv\Scripts\deactivate
```

When all the required packages are installed it is possible to start Mir Commander by running the batch script `dev_run.cmd`.

### Translation
For generation of translation ts-file(s) run `generate_i18n.sh` (in Linux/macOS).
If at least one of ts-files was updated, you need to generate binary translation qm-files using `ts_to_qm.sh` (in Linux/macOS) or `ts_to_qm.cmd` (in Windows).

### Resources
We use external resource files and load them in runtime with the `QResource.registerResource` function as described in the
[Qt documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/resources.html#external-resource-files).
The generation of required binary resource files is done for example as
```
pyside6-rcc resources/icons/general.qrc --binary -o resources/icons/general.rcc
```
This is opposite to the commonly used scheme in PySide, when python modules are created from `qrc` files by the `pyside6-rcc` program.
We avoid this because of two issues: (a) resources are loaded together with module loading and
(b) the data are duplicated in python and in Qt library.

### GUI Design
The creation and adjustment of all GUI elements is coded manually.
We do not use Qt Designer and `ui` files bacause of several reasons:
- this way is not flexible enough and Qt Designer does not allow full manipulation with GUI elements,
- the autogenerated by the `uic` utility python code is usually excessive,
- import commands in the generated python code do not take into account paths to resource modules.

### Code style
In the source code we stick to the principles similar to those described in [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/):
- For class names the [Camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) style is used, like `VerySpecificClass`.
- For variables, methods, functions and modules we use [Snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) style, for example `my_method()`.
- Note, private literals must be started with the underscore (_) character, e.g. `_private_variable` or `_private_method()`.
- Public interfaces must use [Type Hints](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/).

Other principles:
- Prefer string interpolation `f"parameter={par}"` over string `format()` method.
